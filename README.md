This project is a react template created manually without the use of CRA.

To Start the project please run 
- yarn
- yarn start 

The project structure is divided into views and components. 
It uses styled components for styling and each react compnent.
The purpose behind using styled-components is to have the ability and power of using dynamic props in css and the control gained from grouping each css module/ file with its respective component.

Please, pardon any minor issue you might face as well as the styling as I only had 9-10 hours to work on this project during my weekend. I tried as much as I can to fulfill all the acceptence criteria and the expectations.

-I did not have the time to implement unit testing I hope that would not be a blocking 

-I have used multiple ES6 features including but not necessarily limited to Destructuring, arrow functions and spread operator.
-No plugin for the image gallery or pagination
-I haven't used Redux or any kind of complex state management as I didn't find the essential need to do it. So I sticked with some mixture between render props and component composition to narrow down the levels of prop drilling.
