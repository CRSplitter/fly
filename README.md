This project is a react template created manually without the use of CRA whatsoever.

It aims to give you absolute control over your compiler configurations (babel), module bundler configurations (webpack) 
and the entire project.

It uses 
-@babel/core. We need this for babel to do any transformations on our code.
-@babel/preset-env to compile ES6.
-@babel/preset-react to compile jsx and react components.
-babel-cli allows you to compile files from the command line.
